Title: Anthology Monster Pack (AMP) Add-On
Filenames: qsub-AMP.pk3
Author: Brian "That Blind Guy" Willis (modder, beta tester for QuakeStyle ZX and DoomZone, and current co-author of QuakeStyle Unbound)

Misc. Author Info: Quake is in the title, so we need Quake monsters! This is a module of the base mod, but it's important enough to get its own file.

Description: The Anthology Monster Pack module adds 38 new monsters (including 2 bosses) to the already extensive bestiary of QuakeStyle Unbound. The vast majority of these are from Quake and Quake 2, with a couple from Quake 4.

* Summary *

This adds a shedload of new monsters, all of which are either from or based on enemies from Quakes 1, 2, and 4. Every sprite you see is a sprite rip from those games, and sounds were largely taken from those games as well for authenticity.

* Monster List *

There are 38 monsters in this set as of this version. New ones may be added in future releases. Unless there is something worth mentioning here, no information will be given on these monsters, as they largely function the same as they do in Quake. All monsters have been tweaked to fit in with the drop system and enhanced behavior complexity of the rest of Unbound's roster. However, gun-toting monsters will drop random weapons. For example, the Berserk Grunt can drop an Assault Rifle, Machinegun, HyperBlaster, Laser Cannon, or Nailgun.

QUAKE 1
-Death Knight
-Enforcer
-Fiend
-Grunt
-Ialdagorth: A supercharged, oversized Shambler. When it isn't giving you a taste of bullet hell via swarms of electrical orbs, it'll zap you from afar with bolts of lightning similar to the Thunderbolt but with greater range.
-Knight
-Lost Spirit
-Nailgun Enforcer
-Ngyr-Korath: Big brother to the Vore. It can cause spikes to jut out from the ground and summon large groups of zombies up close. From a distance, it will fire enhanced, homing spike balls.
-Ogre
-Multi-Grenade Ogre: As if normal Ogres weren't bad enough, here's one that burst-fires bomblets and even rockets!
-Scrag: Its projectiles are poisonous, so do be careful.
-Shambler
-Silver Knight: A third variant of the Knight. This one will launch a spread of homing projectiles from a distance.
-Spawn: These guys are somehow boring and annoying at the same time, so we turned them into an item bonus identical to the Beheaded Kamikaze. Their explosion is significantly nastier though, so watch yourself.
-Vore
-Wrath
-Zombie: If you don't gib them, they will continue to get back up as Crimson Heads. Fortunately, explosives, energy weapons, and melee attacks will always gib them.

QUAKE 2
-Berserker
-Brains
-Flyer
-Gladiator
-Gunner
-Hover
-Infantry
-Iron Maiden
-Light Guard
-Medic: Sporting an overcomplicated firing pattern!
-Mutant
-Parasite
-Prototype Container: Read "Mini-Macrons".
-Tank Commander: These guys explode upon death. This explosion is roughly equal to a nuke barrel. You have been warned.

QUAKE 4
-Hover Tank
-Sentry
-Slimy Transfer
-Berserk Grunt
-Failed Transfer
-Strogg Roller: Ok, I completely redid these guys. First of all, their twin rocket launchers are replaced with Vanguards (yes, one of the unlockable weapons). Second, they can roll at you to deal damage with as much aggression as a Mauler. If you think you're safe taking high ground or jumping out of the way, they will bounce up to you. These are, by far, the hardest monsters on the Spectre slot.

* MENUDEF Info *

With this expansion in place, a section will be added to Mod Settings->General with options to enable these monsters to spawn and their chance to spawn out of 256. This is the hardest of the three sets of monsters on tap for the mod, so a spawn chance of 64 (25%) is recommended.
