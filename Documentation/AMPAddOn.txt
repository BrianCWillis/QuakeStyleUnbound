Title: Anthology Monster Pack (AMP) Add-On
Filenames: qsub-AMP.pk3
Author: Brian "That Blind Guy" Willis (modder, beta tester for QuakeStyle ZX and DoomZone, and current co-author of QuakeStyle Unbound)
Email Address: briancwillis2010@yahoo.com
Misc. Author Info: Quake is in the title, so we need Quake monsters! This mod will NOT work without QuakeStyle Unbound.

Description: Monster Closet adds 39 new monsters (including 2 bosses) to the already extensive bestiary of QuakeStyle Unbound. The vast majority of these are from Quake and Quake 2, with a couple from Quake 4.

			  DBThanatos and Michaelis for Quake Champion: Doom Edition
			  SilentZorah, Bathy Salts, TehNems, and BigBenkei for beta testing
			  id Software for Quake, Quake II, Quake III, Quake IV, DOOM, and some sprites and sounds.
			  The good folks at zdoom.org's forums who've put up with our insane (and sometimes inane) questions
			  Randi Heit for the godlike ZDoom (may it rest in peace)
			  Graf Zahl for DECORATE and the godlike GZDoom
			  DRD Team for the repository builds of ZDoom, QZDoom and GZDoom
