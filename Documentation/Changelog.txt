ADDITIONS
General:
-Alt-fire ammo counts are visible on the Weapon Wheel.
-Added a flashlight that can be toggled using the Zoom key. You can also turn it off with primary or alt-fire.
-Gunslinger class added as a replacement for Doomed Guy
-The player can now drop ammo for their current weapon.
-"X-Spawners" When playing on Ultra-Violence, cacos, demons, spectres, and Hell Knights can occasionally be promoted to stronger monsters. On Nightmare and Legendary Doom Slayer, the same is true, but zombies can also be replaced with higher-level variants. On Hurt Me More, every monster spawner is an X variant except for Cyberdemons and Spider Masterminds. Those that do not promote to a higher tier skew in favor of the stronger monsters on their own tier.
-Secret combo fire modes are now available for all unscoped weapons except the Carrion, Static Cannons, Ripley, and Sasha.
-A mod settings menu has been added to the main menu to put all the mod stuff in one place.
-You now have the option to select from a variety of fullscreen HUD styles: none, minimal, simple, classic, detailed, and fancy.
-Monster status/item name displays.
-Class Info screen detailing the properties of each character class.
-Random ammo bonus for 100% secrets.
-Health upgrade for 100% kills.
-Rare and guest weapons are now given for 100% item collection.

Monsters:
-Eye of Malady, a turret that replaces the Evil Eye prop.
-Core Tentacle and Lava Tentacle, turrets the replace the Tech Pillar and Floating Skull props respectively. These only appear on Ultra-Violence, Nightmare, TNT, Hurt Me More, and Legendary Doom Slayer difficulties.
-Blot, a leaping cloud of mist that does constant splash damage when close to its target.
-Nightmare Spectre. With Monster Closet active, this appears in place of Spectres, which are moved to the normal Demon spawner.
-Axe Guy, making all non-unique melee weapons available to monsters.
-Cryo Demon, a palette-swapped Baron that throws ice projectiles.
-Hexa-Shotgunner, a zombie brandishing the Nutcracker.
-Plague, an armored Pain Elemental that fires homing missiles which explode in clouds of poison.
-Lurker, a Spectre-like Cacodemon that fires two energy balls that weave in a figure-eight pattern.
-43 new monsters from or based on those from the Quake series. These are placed in their own expansion. These can be toggled on and off and spawn chance can be adjusted in the mod settings menu. When these are chosen for spawning, there is no bias. Each subset is completely random.
-7 Wolfenstein-based enemies; 5 Nazis and 2 mutants.

Weapons:
-Static Cannon, based on the weapon by the same name from Doom 2016. Primary fires two beams for 1% charge. Alt spends the entire charge for a progressively stronger beam. Faster charge with Haste effect.
-Hyperion, a double rifle inspired by Borderlands. Primary fires a single, powerful round from one barrel. Alt fires 20 weaker pellets if fully loaded - 10 if one barrel has already been fired. It can be reloaded manually after the first shot and will automatically reload after both barrels are spent.
-Electro-Driver, the "shurikens-and-lightning gun" from Painkiller. Primary fires shurikens, and alt fires homing lightning balls. Combo fire releases a shuriken charged by a lightning ball that homes in on a target, then explodes on contact.
-Sparqbeam, the energy-based stun pistol from System Shock. Primary fires a weaker beam that will stun one enemy. Mild splash damage makes multiple stuned targets possible. Alt fires a stronger beam with a larger blast radius. Combo throws the cell being used as a magazine for the weapon as a stun grenade.
-Nutcracker hexa-shotgun. We now have a ballistic superweapon. Primary fires 60 buckshot pellets that force gibbing. Alt fires a spread of six frag-12 shells, each packing more power than a proximity mine. Combo releases a cannonball that rolls along the ground, running over any enemies it touches and exploding after a few seconds with half the force and radius of an Arbiter nuke.
-ETF Rifle, a double-barrel nail carbine, as a class-exclusive weapon for the Slipgater. Primary fires a single nail. Alt performs a zoomed double-tap. Pressing the reload key alternates between lava nails and explosive-topped flechettes.
-"Boone" Suppressed Sniper Rifle as a class-exclusive weapon for the Sniper. Functionally identical to the Sniper Rifle, but capable of performing stealth kills.
-"Schabbs" Needle Gun as a class-exclusive weapon for the Medic. Primary fires three normal needles. Alt fires three lava needles. Combo rapid-fires a spread of eight flechettes.
-"Trident" Homing Rocket Launcher as a class-exclusive weapon for the Demolitionist. Primary fires a three-round burst of homing missiles. Alt fires a spread of napalm pellets. Combo releases an incendiary rocket that dispenses napalm as it flies.
-"Ironside" Mace and Shield as a class-exclusive weapon for the Berserker. Primary fire swings the mace. Alt-fire raises the shield, making the user invulnerable but slow. This can be interrupted with a quick, weaker mace swing by pressing primary fire or a powerful fire wave attack that uses health by pressing reload.
-"Rapier" DMR as a class-exclusive weapon for the Marksman. Primary fires an invisible rail attack that damages everything in its path. Alt performs a radial kick. Combo sacrifices ripping damage and accuracy to autofire the weapon.
-"Ghost" Tactical Shotgun as a class-exclusive weapon for the Hunter. Primary and alt are identical to the Shotgun with the stealth kill bonus. Combo throws a decoy that will explode after 15 seconds. There is no ammo for this, but the decoy requires a cooldown period before it can be used again.
-"Kestrel" Heavy Assault Rifle as a class-exclusive weapon for the Ranger. Primary and combo are the same as the Assault Rifle, but with higher damage, accuracy, and double ammo consmption. Alt fires two homing mini-missiles.
-"Vance" Submachine Gun as a class-exclusive weapon for the Infantry. Primary is the same as the Machinegun, but trading damage for fire rate. Alt fires a timed mine dart that will explode after a brief time if stuck to a wall or immediately on contact with an actor.
-"Ripley" Custom HAMR as a class-exclusive weapon for the Gunner. Primary fires faster than the HAMR. Alt fires a liquid flamethrower instead of a plasma torch, spreading napalm fire and consuming cells at a rapid rate.
-"Wastelander" Single Shotgun as a class-exclusive weapon for the Gunslinger. Primary fires extremely inaccurate but poertgul nuvkdhoy. Alt fires bouncing metal shards. Combo fires electric buckshot that can stun targets.

Bugs Fixed
-Heavy was immune to poison. Solution: List Damage Factors for each Damage Type rather than generalizing with the normal factor.
-Revolver entry on the weapon wheel was always showing a zero at the top. Solution: Reference the correct actor in the wheel's code.
-Walls of errors and warnings were showing when the game loads. Solution: Mostly removing floating-point values from integer parameters and fixing incorrect references in GLDefs, among other little things.
-Weapon Wheel was displaying "Actor 'NONE' could not be found" on every frame that it was opened if the player had dev messages turned on. Solution: "NONE" is not allowed as an actor name, so it was replaced with "NOAMMO."
-Several lights were not showing. Solution: Assign them correctly.
-One of the Diablost's summons didn't work. Solution: Spell the actor's name correctly.
-Homing Afrit balls had no lights. Solution: Copy the normal Afrit Ball lights to them.
-Ammo dropping created conflicts with the weapon/item wheels. Solution: Change weapon wheel key combo to strafe+moveup and the key combo for item wheel to strafe+movedown.
-Deep One wasn't fading in and out properly. Solution: Use A_FadeTo instead of A_FadeOut.
-Phantasm was getting stuck in its charge animation if it took damage while charging. Solution: Go to Missile+1 instead of Missile+2 at the end of the Missile state.
-Fixed the long-standing bug where the Chainsaw idle sound would continue after it was dropped.
-AoE ice attacks would freeze boss spawners. Upon shattering, the mod would crash GZDoom. Solution: Set DamageFactor of spawners to 0.
-Revolver sounds were being interrupted by player sounds. Solution: Change Revolver sounds' audio channels to CHAN_WEAPON.
-It was impossible to reliably get 100% items on any map. Solution: Make only non-weapon spawners, not the items, count toward percentage.
-Flames and gas clouds were not inflicting the right amount of self-damage. Solution: Use CMF_TRACKOWNER to preserve the necessary pointers.
-Napalm fire projectiles fizzled out in mid-air. Solution: Have their spawn state loop.
-Blood and gibs wouldn't despawn after 30-60 seconds. Solution: Remove the -1 tic timers.
